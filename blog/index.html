				<h3>Progress</h3>
				<em>01/31/2016</em>
				<p>
					The application can now communicate from database to android application. I have test data in the database that can be accessed through 
					a simple API to read on the android application. Spring have android functionality that makes communicating with a RESTful API, however 
					the implementation is very bulky and needs serious improvement to be feasible for the application. I will need to wrap the framework in 
					a facade to keep to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a> as much as possible. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As for further development it is important to finish the architecture in order to move on. This architecture includes things like, 
					getting the server and DB on an actual fixed server and not my laptop. It is also important to complete the CI builds with 
					<a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins</a>, which integrates well with maven and git, so that I can use good build practices 
					to allow quick and easy deployment.
				</p> 
				<p>
					I have broken down the first set of stories in the "Log In" epic into the main stories that I can think of to implement a user 
					being able to log in. Future stories will be broken and prioritised along with other stories, to ensure the main functionality is 
					implemented, as time goes along.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first plan of action to obvious, to implement the User sign up and log in functionality. UX and security are the main focus for 
					sign up and log in.

				<h3>Barebones</h3>
				<em>01/29/2016</em>
				<p>The barebones of an application are coming together. A test web service is set up and almost connected with the database. 
					The database server seems to have permissions issues blocking progress. Otherwise, the RESTful web service is working with basic 
					mocked data. I created a kanban board using <a href="https://taiga.io">Taiga</a>, a very useful free agile software development tool 
					that I will be using to track issues, new work, work in progress, work ready for testing or work completed. At the moment there are 
					huge stories(I would normally call epics) that I will break down into smaller stories and do correct pointing and split them 
					by priority. I've set up a personal schedule for myself to do work on this project which may change as I go along depending on 
					how development goes. Still a lot of work to do creating the android application, I am new to android development so there will 
					be some growing pains however I hope to quickly get the connection with the application and the server all the way through to the 
					DB working very soon. All of the repositories are set up and hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, another very 
					nice to use and free git repository hosting service.</p>
