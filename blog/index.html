				<h3>Log In Successful</h3>
				<em>02/24/2016</em>
				<p>
					The log in now works. I had issues for a few days with returning the salt from the database and using it in the hash function. 
					Solved this issue by storing the salt as a hex string which for some reason stays the same when converted to and from bytes unlike a 
					string in java. Strange issue but it works now. The android code gave issues with converting to hex string due to lack of libraries 
					for android.
				</p>
				<p>
					I now need to create a transition from the log in screen to the main screen of the application. This will need some design work on the 
					UI front. I also need to get Logging implemented for the server and android. I started design on the data models for the rest of the 
					tables in the database, these are all initial ideas for the structures so they can be refactored later.
				</p>

				<h3>Sign Up/Testing</h3>
				<em>02/11/2016</em>
				<p>
					Users can now sign up through the server. The user must enter a name, email and password to register. The password is encrypted with a 
					random salt and stored in the DB. I've fixed the issue with the repetitve code and made a generic service caller for calling the 
					server from the application. I've added CORS to the server also, so that the application can communicate with the server. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The next plan of action is to implement tests, create documentation and finish the CI builds. All new development stops until tests, 
					documentation and CI build are completed.
				</p>

				<h3>Progress</h3>
				<em>01/31/2016</em>
				<p>
					The application can now communicate from database to android application. I have test data in the database that can be accessed through 
					a simple API to read on the android application. Spring have android functionality that makes communicating with a RESTful API, however 
					the implementation is very bulky and needs serious improvement to be feasible for the application. I will need to wrap the framework in 
					a facade to keep to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a> as much as possible. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As for further development it is important to finish the architecture in order to move on. This architecture includes things like, 
					getting the server and DB on an actual fixed server and not my laptop. It is also important to complete the CI builds with 
					<a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins</a>, which integrates well with maven and git, so that I can use good build practices 
					to allow quick and easy deployment.
				</p> 
				<p>
					I have broken down the first set of stories in the "Log In" epic into the main stories that I can think of to implement a user 
					being able to log in. Future stories will be broken and prioritised along with other stories, to ensure the main functionality is 
					implemented, as time goes along.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first plan of action is to implement the User sign up and log in functionality. UX and security are the main focus for 
					sign up and log in.

				<h3>Barebones</h3>
				<em>01/29/2016</em>
				<p>The barebones of an application are coming together. A test web service is set up and almost connected with the database. 
					The database server seems to have permissions issues blocking progress. Otherwise, the RESTful web service is working with basic 
					mocked data. I created a kanban board using <a href="https://taiga.io">Taiga</a>, a very useful free agile software development tool 
					that I will be using to track issues, new work, work in progress, work ready for testing or work completed. At the moment there are 
					huge stories(I would normally call epics) that I will break down into smaller stories and do correct pointing and split them 
					by priority. I've set up a personal schedule for myself to do work on this project which may change as I go along depending on 
					how development goes. Still a lot of work to do creating the android application, I am new to android development so there will 
					be some growing pains however I hope to quickly get the connection with the application and the server all the way through to the 
					DB working very soon. All of the repositories are set up and hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, another very 
					nice to use and free git repository hosting service.</p>
