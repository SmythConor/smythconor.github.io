				<h3>Barebones</h3>
				<em>01/29/2016</em>
				<p>The barebones of an application are coming together. A test web service is set up and almost connected with the database. The database server seems to have permissions issues blocking progress. Otherwise, the RESTful web service is working with basic mocked data. I created a kanban board using <a href="https://taiga.io">Taiga</a>, a very useful free agile software development tool that I will be using to track issues, new work, work in progress, work ready for testing or work completed. At the moment there are huge stories(I would normally call epics) that I will break down into smaller stories and do correct pointing and split them by priority. I've set up a personal schedule for myself to do work on this project which may change as I go along depending on how development goes. Still a lot of work to do creating the android application, I am new to android development so there will be some growing pains however I hope to quickly get the connection with the application and the server all the way through to the DB working very soon. All of the repositories are set up and hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, another very nice to use and free git repository hosting service.</p>
